             <p>As a developer, I bring a diverse set of programming skills and experiences to the table. My journey in software development spans various languages and frameworks, each contributing to my comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end development.
             </p>
             <p>Java: My expertise in Java is demonstrated through a project focused on optimizing seating arrangements at a circular table, which involved intricate algorithmic challenges. This project required me to embed dislike data directly into the code, showcasing my ability to handle complex logic and data manipulation.

             </p>
             <p>PHP: I have developed a web application using PHP and a local XAMPP server. This application manages a "products" database with multiple tables, enhancing my skills in server-side scripting and relational database management. It's a robust platform that integrates product details such as ID, name, category, description, price, rating, and image path.

             </p>
             <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: I am proficient in creating interactive web elements and have spearheaded the development of a 10-page website utilizing HTML5. This project emphasized reusability and innovative design, including a unique Rainbow Border Animation using CSS. My work showcases a deep understanding of web standards, responsive design, and user experience enhancement.

            </p>
             <p>JavaFX: In the realm of graphical user interfaces, my work with JavaFX stands out. I've managed multiple user interfaces for applications such as City Management, Customer Service, and Menu Management. This experience underlines my capability to develop intuitive and efficient GUIs, ensuring a seamless user experience.

             </p>
             <p>Git: I am well-versed in using Git as a version control system, which is crucial for managing changes to project codebases, collaborating with teams, and maintaining a historical record of projects. My proficiency in Git supports my ability to work effectively in team settings, ensuring robust, error-free code management across the development lifecycle.
